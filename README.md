## This extension enables Lambda Code programming language support in vscode.

#### ( Syntax highlighting only. autocomplete, debugging and other features will come later )

<br>
Lambda Code is a new high level programming language. Its syntax is as easy as python and will be fast as C++. Because the language will get compiled to pure C++. Not like Cython. The language is in development for now.

If you want to contribute to the language please check out the official github [repo](https://github.com/Lambda-Code-Organization/Lambda-Code)

or if you want to contribute to the extension then go to the github repo (on the sidebar)
